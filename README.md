# Python Beginner to Intermediate Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I've shared some Python practice projects that range from beginner to intermediate levels. Most of them are command-line based, while a few others are GUI applications.

## Projects with GUI

1. **Pomodoro App**: A productivity app based on the Pomodoro Technique, helping you stay focused and productive.

2. **Snake Game Clone**: A classic implementation of the Snake game, where you control a snake to eat food and grow longer.

3. **Flash Cards Project**: A GUI flashcard application to help you study and memorize various topics.

4. **Kanye Quotes**: A fun project that fetches random Kanye West quotes from an API and displays them on the GUI.

5. **Miles to Kilometer Converter**: A simple GUI tool to convert distances from miles to kilometers.

6. **Turtle Art Challenge**: A program using the Python Turtle module to create beautiful art designs.

7. **Turtle Roadcross Game**: A simple game using Turtle graphics where you control an object to cross the road safely.

8. **US States Project**: A project to learn and quiz yourself on US state names.

## Note About Code

- **File Locations**: Please be aware that the file locations in the code may differ on your machine. Make sure to modify the file paths before running the codes.

- **Commented Code**: You might come across some parts of the code that are commented out, which might seem unnecessary. This was a personal preference I had at the time of writing the code. Feel free to clean up the code if you find it confusing.

## Contribution and Feedback

These projects are open-source, and I welcome any contributions or improvements you'd like to make. If you find any of these projects useful or enjoyable, don't forget to leave a star to show your appreciation!

Thank you for visiting this repository, and happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
